# Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to write a generic class and a generic method. To accomplish this you will write a linked list that circles back on itself. We will also look at exception throwing and handling.

## Instructions

- Create a _class library_ project called "GenericsHomework.". ✔
- Create a node class that can contain a value of any type and points to the next node and traversing the next node points back to the first item.
  - Define the `Node` class
  - The values should be homogeneous.
  - Include a constructor that takes a value. (No validation is necessary on the value). ✔
  - Add a `ToString()` override that writes out the value's `ToString()` result. ✔
  - Add a `Next` property that references the next node or else refers back to itself if there are no other nodes in the list. ✔
    - The `Next` property should be non-nullable (careful to follow the non-nullable property guidelines) ✔
    - The `Next` property setter should be private. ✔
  - Add an `Append` method that takes a value and appends a new `Node` instance after the current node (by invoking the `Next` property). ✔
  - Add a Clear method that effectively removes all items from a list except the current node. Pay attention as to whether you should be concerned with the following:
    - Whether it is sufficient to only set Next to itself ✔
    - Whether to set the removed items to circle back on themselves. In other words, whether to close the loop of the removed items. (Provide a test to show why this is required if it is required). ✔
    - Given there is a circular list of items, provide a comment to indicate whether you need to worry about garbage collection because all the items point to each other and therefore may never be garbage collected. ✔
  - Create an Exists method to test to see if a value exists in the list. ✔
  - Throw an error on an attempt to Append a duplicate value. (Make sure you test for this case) ✔
- You should not rely on any BCL generic classes for your implementation. ✔

## Fundamentals

- Place all shared project properties into a `Directory.Build.Props` file.
- Place all shared project items into a `Directory.Build.targets` file.
- nullable reference types is enabled ✔
- Ensure that you turn on code analysis for all projects(EnableNETAnalyzers) ✔
- Set LangVersion and the TargetFramework to the latest released versions available (preview versions optional) ✔
- and enabled .NET analyzers for both projects ✔
- For this assignment, always use `Assert.AreEqual<T>()` (the generic version) ✔
- All of the above should be unit tested ✔
- Choose simplicity over complexity ✔
